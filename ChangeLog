	* src/: jxta_advertisement.c, jxta_advertisement.h, jxta_relaya.c,

	  advertisement parsing functionality. This patch greatly improves the
	  ability to include one advertisement type within another especially
	  when the type of sub-advertisement is not explicitly known.

	  The external API for advertisement parsing as used by applications
	  remains unchanged.

	  The jxta_svc advertisement which includes a lot of use of
	  sub-advertisements is also significantly refactored to simplfy its
	  implementation with the advertisement improvements.

	  relayAdvertisement needed tweaks as well because it relied upon
	  hackery in svc for much of it's parsing. This has now been
	  corrected. Eventually the hackery in svc can be removed.

	  ISO C-99 provides a va_copy function. It's not clear from the C spec
