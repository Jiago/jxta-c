Linux/Solaris
========================================================================
On most Linux distribution, libapr was built with Berkeley DB support. I
would recommend you to isntall the libapr distributed by your
distribution and use Berkeley DB as the default DBM. I have tested this
configuration with Debian and Suse(JDS does not seems to provide apr,
however, you can try RPM from Suse 9)

To test if your system have libapr installed and support Berkeley DB:

$ apr-config --includedir

If libapr was installed, you should see it print out the folder which
contains the header files. On Debian, it is /usr/include/apr-0, on Suse,
it is /usr/include/apache2.

Next step, make sure that libapr was built with Berkeley DB support.

grep APU_HAVE_DB /usr/include/apr-0/apu.h

You will see a line like following, if the value is 1, that means
Berkeley DB support is built into libapr. You are good to use it to
build jxta-c.

#define APU_HAVE_DB     1


If you are using CVS, replace configure with autogen.sh in the
following.

System with libapr and Berkely DB isntalled
------------------------------------------------------------------------
./configure --without-apr --with-dbm=db
make
make install


System without libapr, Berkeley DB or with libapr does not support
Berkeley DB
------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need a patched build of apr-util for SDBM. You can download a
pre-built library at
http://jxta-c.jxta.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList.

Create a lib folder in the jxta-c folder and untar the file.

./configure
make
make install


Windows
========================================================================
You will need a patched build of apr-util for SDBM. You can download a
pre-built library at:

http://jxta-c.jxta.org/files/documents/141/204/apr-0.9.6-win32.zip

Create a lib folder in your jxta-c folder and unzip the file. You should
now see a Apache2 folder within the lib folder.

The jxtalib.dsp can be located in win32/jxta/jxtalib/jxtalib.dsp, and
the shell is in win32/JxtaShell/JxtaShell.dsp. I believe you know how to
build it from here. :-)
