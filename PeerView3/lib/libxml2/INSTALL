If wildcard searching is required the modifications provided in the 
"jxta_wildcard.diffs" file. The version provided is a patch against 
libxml2-2.6.19, but should work against other versions as well.
Also provided is an autogen.sh script for building the new library 
needed by the discovery service. 

Here are the steps for building the custom library:

0) Download the latest version of the libxml2 source from 
   <http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html>. These instructions assume version 2.6.19
1) cd lib/libxml2
2) tar -zxf libxml2-2.6.19
3) patch -p0 -i jxta_wildcard.diffs
4) cd libxml2-2.6.19
5) chmod +x autogen.sh
6) exec ./autogen.sh
7) make
8) make install

This will build and install the modified libraries in the libxml2-2.6.19 directory 
that are required for the enhanced discovery service supporting wild card searches.
