	J2SE Testing relay & rendezvous platform
	========================================


This package is destinated to the people who want to test jxta-c
against the J2SE platform. The package includes:

	- J2SE platform
	- J2SE shell
	- added commands (ping)
	- pre-cooked configuration


Fast track
----------

If what you want to do is to quickly install a J2SE peer that will run
on the local IP address 127.0.0.1, with TCP enabled on port 9701 and
the HTTP relay enabled on port 9700, all you have to do is to:

	- create a directory & go in it
	- unzip in that directory the file bin/j2sepeer.zip
	- if you run a UNIX box, you can use the shell script run.sh, otherwise
	  run 	java -classpath j2sepeer.jar  net.jxta.impl.peergroup.Boot.
	- the peer is pre-configured, just update the user name and password
          (security panel), and the peer will be ready to go.

	- the shell should come up.



Configuring
-----------

	- if the default setting are not appropriate, you can
          change them into the configuration panel (refer to the platform
          documentation). The shell command "peerconfig" can be used to force
          a re-configuration.

	- the default configuration comes with debug logs turned of. Use the
          configurator if you want to change the level of debug log (debug is
          usually what you want).

	
Building
--------

If you want to add debug code into the J2SE, or if you want to add your own
shell debug commands, you can build the add-on java files by:

$ make cmds

In order to make the proper package:

$ make zip
