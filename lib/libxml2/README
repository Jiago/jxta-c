The libxml2 library has been modified in order to provide wild card searching 
of text elements with the Enhanced Discovery Service. If wild card searches 
are not required these steps are not necessary. If there is a libxml2 library 
available on the system you can use that version, but you won't be able to use
wildcard searches.

See INSTALL for instructions on building the custom version of libxml2.
