Test scripts can be run a number of different ways.

1) Individually - Executing the command, i.e. ./mia_adv_test mia.xml

2) testall.sh - A testall script will execute all the *_test files. For the test files requiring a parameter the parameter is built using the * portion of the file and concatenated with ".xml".

3) testWithINP.sh - A script that reads an input file, optionally specified on the command line, and executes each line. Groups of tests can be identified for selective execution and Report summaries. When the tests are executed a log file is created from the output of the test programs. Results are collected and a summary report is generated. The format of the report can be modified when the script is executed.

Usage Options

-v -- Verbose. Output all messages that are generated from tests to the console. <quiet>
-l extension -- log file extension for the log file of the test. <.log>
-i name -- custom tests file name <tests.inp>
-t name -- tee output file name. A file name can be specified that will contain all console output from the test program. This is used in conjunction with -v (verbose). <none>
-d --- include test detail in summary report. This specifies that the summary report will contain the return codes of each         individual test. If not specified only a summary of the groups executed is provided. <none>
-x group name --- Ignore this test group. A group or multiple groups can be ignored when executing the test programs. These groups are defined in the ".inp" file. <none>
-h/? - help summary.

Input File for execution.

An input file is required for execution of the testWithINP.sh script. The file specifies groups of tests and the tests executed within the group. To specify a group of tests the file should contain a line testGroup:name. The name will be used for the summary report along with the ability to ignore this group for a particular test run. After the testGroup:name all lines following will be execution commands of the tests until the next testGroup:name. There is a "#" indicator provided for comments.
