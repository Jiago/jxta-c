This directory will eventually contain NSIS scripts
for installing a jxta development env for Win32.   
This will contain all the apr header files and libs
so that a developer can just install this and start
programming jxta directly.  


The goal is to have the NSIS script find out where 
MS DEv is installed, then install the jxta libraries
and header files in the MS Dev include and lib trees.
This normalizes the locations of these files so 
that developers don't have to continually fiddle with
project settings.
